# Pizza Time! - Project 1

## Project Proposal
A single player game in which the goal is to "build a pizza" by catching certain toppings and avoiding others. Each round is complete once you've succesfully built the pizza prescribed by the menu on the screen.

## Game Objective
As Player 1 (i.e. the Chef), your goal is to collect the toppings that are prescribed on the menu - in the order they are listed - and dodge the toppings that are not listed. You will have three pizzas in total to "build", and each round, the toppings will be progressively more complex.

#### How to win/ move onto the next level
- Stack the correct toppings until your pizza is complete. 
#### How to lose
- Stack an incorrect topping (by neglecting to dodge it).

### Instructions
- Use *left* and *right* arrows to move your crust back and forth across the screen.
- Catch only the toppings that are prescribed by a "menu" that is displayed on the screen.
- Dodge the toppings that you don't want.
- Once your pizza is complete, "Buon appetito" displays on the screen.

### Technologies and Tools Used
- Pizza Time was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I used Phaser.io to implement much of the game functionality (with JavaScript), including the "overlap" between the chef and the toppings, the topping "particles" themselves, and the chef's movements with the arrow keys.

### Development Approach
1. Find and download PNG files of the chef, each of the toppings, and the background.
2. Program the chef to move back and forth across the screen.
3. Use a JavaScript constructor to produce "emitters" (i.e. the toppings falling from the sky).
4.
