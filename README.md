Pizza Game - Project 1

A readme.md file which includes your project proposal, including personas, user stories, wireframes, etc. explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

# Project Proposal
A single player game in which the goal is to "build a pizza" by catching certain toppings and avoiding others. Each round is complete once you've succesfully built the pizza prescribed by the menu on the screen. 

## User Story
As Player 1 (i.e. the Chef), your goal is to collect the toppings that are prescribed on the menu - in the order they are listed - and dodge the toppings that are not listed. You will have three pizzas in total to "build", and each round, the toppings will be progressively more complex.

### Instructions
- Use *left* and *right* arrows to move your crust back and forth across the screen.
- Catch only the toppings that are prescribed by a "menu" that is displayed on the screen.
- Dodge the toppings that you don't want.
- Once your pizza is complete, "Buon appetito" displays on the screen.

#### How to win/ move onto the next level
- Stack the correct toppings until your pizza is complete. 
#### How to lose
- Stack an incorrect topping (by neglecting to dodge it).
